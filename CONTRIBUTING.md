# Contributing to revolutiongame:
There are many ways to contribute to revolution. Here are the ones we are accepting:
## Suggestions and Bug Reports
GitHub's Issue system is great for this, which is why we use it. Submitting a bug report? Tag it with bug? Something else? Find a related tag. You can even style the posts with markdown. How neat.
## Code Contribution
If you would rather add code to the project, you can do that as well! Since we are open-source, you can always submit a pull request!
For pull request criteria, look below:
* If you are submitting an upgradable, please make an application in the **revolutiongame-demos** repository, which can be found at http://github.com/PokeWorld/revolutiongame-demos.
* If you are fixing a bug, state what bug you are fixing in the pull request.
* Do not write messy code. This is Trey's job and Justin cleans up after him enough. We don't want to raise his salary.

That's it! We hope you enjoy contributing to our project!
